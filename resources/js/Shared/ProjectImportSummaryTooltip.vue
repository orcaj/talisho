            Select a previously created project to copy as a template for specifying which
            General Requirements you would like to include in this current project. Note that the
            assignment of these documents will initially be to yourself and the due date will
            default to "TBD By Contractor" for all documents assigned via this method. You will
            still have the ability to edit these settings from the Documentation page, as well as
            add any new General Requirement documents that may be specifically required for
            this particular project.
